# Installing on MacOS

## Prerequisite

Need to have brew, cmake, go and ninja installed

```
#install brew

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"\n

brew install cmake

brew install ninja

brew install go
```

## installing BoringSSL

```
git clone https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl
cd boringssl

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
```

and if the above procedure succeeds, you may want to run the built-in self test from the main *boringssl* directory

```
go run ../util/all_tests.go
```
